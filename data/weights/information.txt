First:
    These are weights initialize with Yolo v2 architecture trained on COCO dataset,
    and then train LINEMOD for classfication.           ### Done

Training plan:
    1. pre-train on Linemod 'ape', set confidence mask coef = 0
    in author's repo, pre train has 80,200 batches with 32 batch size
    when batch size down to 8, pre train have to run 320,800 batches
    in my implementation, run 200 epoches with batch size 8 (about 150 batches per epoch)   ### train 54 epoches

    2. train 'ape' ### 

    3. test
